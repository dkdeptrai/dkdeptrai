# 👋 Hi there, I'm Khoa Nguyen

### 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a **Backend Software Engineer** specializing in **Kotlin** and **Spring Boot**, with a focus on building and optimizing high-throughput scalable systems.

* **Performance Optimization:** Recently achieved a **40% reduction in API latency** by refactoring I/O-intensive services using **concurrency and parallelism**.
* **System Reliability:** Hands-on experience resolving complex **distributed system** challenges, including fixing **Redis concurrency anti-patterns** (read-modify-write) and managing race conditions.
* **Architecture:** Skilled in implementing **multi-tenant architectures** and granular entitlement systems for enterprise-grade B2B2C platforms.
* **Mission:** I am driven by the challenge of translating complex business requirements into **high-performance, maintainable, and auditable code**.
